    Bello~ This is a comment, which means no one see me when the file is rendered and you can feel free to remove me ahh~

    A comment can also be used to prevent auto generating of hyperlink (see 1)

    This project uses Marked.js to render a md file, then formats the rendered stuff again ahh~

    If you need to make to line close, add \ after the former line (see 1 also)
    If you need to start a new paragraph, double line break

    Here are the stuff which have been styled:

    #, ##, ## stands for header 1, 2 and 3, header 1 is centered.

    > starts a blockquote, which means

    > This
    > is
    > blockquote
    > ahh

    Things in a blockquote are centered. (see 2)

    - makes a bullet point (see 3)

    There are many other features in Markdown language.
    Me didn't make use and style all of them in this project.
    For more information about Markdown language, google by yourself lah hehehe
